State: Entry
Welcome to my starter game. We will parse everything until a `State` or `On` entry and make it part of the caption.

On ["Hello", "Hi", "Yo"]: (transition Exit)
On ["My name is {name}"]: (store name) (print "Nice to meet you, {name}")
On *: (print "This isn't how you play") (transition Entry)

State: Exit
You figured me out!

On *: (end)

state:
	tag: value
	description: value
	conditions:
		on:
			(
				input:value
				set:
					[input:value]

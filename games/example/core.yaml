            It's hard to say what's so mysterious about it.
            That is what's so mysterious.

            In this room, there is a large archway. You can easily walk through it, but nothing happens.
            Large cables run to the archway. It seems to need power.

            The cables hum with the power *coursing* through them. The archway crackles, 
            its energy forming a hazy portal within it.

            You have exited the maze.

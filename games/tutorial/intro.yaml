      # Welcome to Fictive
      Fictive is a tool for writing interactive fiction games.

      This game is meant to be an introduction to how it works. Fictive is still a work in progress, and likely will be for awhile. Is is, however, full featured enough to be useful, and this tutorial will teach you how to write games for it.
      
      To get started, you must have some basic understanding of how to use your terminal/command-prompt, and a text editor. Familiarity with YAML helps, but is not required.

      At almost any time, you can type "exit" or "quit" to leave the tutorial game.

      Type `next` to move on.

        When writing Fictive, you are designing a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). Each **state** represents a "page" in your story. A key moment where the player can make a choice. The user types their command into the prompt, and based on their input and the **transition** you defined, it moves them to the next **state**.

        You will write your games in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), which is both a simple markup language, and offers some conveniences for organizing your games.

        Do you want to learn more about:

        * `about` Fictive
        * `start`ing a Fictive - build a simple game
        * `organizing` your game
        * `transitions` - more on how to move between states
        * `triggers` and the `statebag` - a game with memory
        * `advanced` transitions
        * `sub`machines

        Or type `exit` to exit.

        Fictive is an interactive fiction tool that strikes a balance between the simulation-oriented approach of traditional [Inform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform) style games and the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure approach of tools like [Twine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine_\(software\)).

        Fictive is:
        
        * Markdown enabled - display your text with powerful, but simple markup
        * terminal first - everything works from a command line, like the classic games
        * web-enabled - your games can be served via the web
        * simple but flexible, with an extremely powerful transition system to string your story together
        * free-form commands - instead of stock verbs, or direct links, game designers can create arbitrary commands
        * YAML-focused - by leveraging some of YAML's more advanced features, it's easy to modularize and organize your game.
        * Full of `statebag`s -the easy-to-use `statebag` system makes it easy to give your game "memory", allowing early choices to influence later portions of the game.

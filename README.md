# Fictive

A state-machine based interactive fiction tool. Still in an early draft state, not usable by anyone else. Everything is likely to change.

## Current Status
Parses a YAML file into a state machine. Then provides an interactive prompt where users provide textual input, which gets evaluated and causes the state machine to transition to new states.
